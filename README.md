# CS-142 Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of programming projects and assignments completed during CS 142 â€” an introductory computer science course focused on problem-solving through code. The work spans C++, Python, and JavaScript, and demonstrates my early development as a programmer.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Procedural programming in C++
- Object-oriented programming fundamentals
- Basic file I/O and command-line tools
- Python scripting and module organization
- JavaScript canvas capture and DOM manipulation
- Server/client concepts with minimal HTTP servers

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **C++**: Introductory object-oriented programming
- **Python**: Scripting and interfaces
- **JavaScript**: Web canvas, DOM manipulation
- **Tableau**: Simple data visualization (see `.twb` file)

## ðŸ“‚ Notable Files

- `ItemToPurchase.cpp`: Simple class exercise modeling a purchasable item
- `httpserver.cpp`: Basic HTTP server logic using C++ sockets
- `interface.py`: Python module for interacting with program components
- `capture_canvas.js`, `InsertFGElement.js`: JavaScript for web-based drawing and media interaction
- `Adam's Tableau Project.twb`: Data viz project (Tableau Workbook)

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

Most of these projects are independent and language-specific:

### C++ Files:
```bash
g++ ItemToPurchase.cpp -o item
./item
